This package will provide tools that aim to make working with the `phyloseq`-package easier. In addition, it will include tools to import data (focussing on the current structure of output in the Bogaert lab).


## To do

- other conversion functions phyloseq (CLR?)
- back-conversion (e.g. after editing metadata using tidyverse-functions)
